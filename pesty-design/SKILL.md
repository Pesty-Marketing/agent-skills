Read the `readme.md` file within this skill, and explore the other available files.
If creating visual artifacts (slides, mocks, throwaway prototypes, etc), copy assets out and create static HTML files for the user to view. If working on production code, you can copy assets and read the rules here to become an expert in designing with this brand.
If the user invokes this skill without any other guidance, ask them what they want to build or design, ask some questions, and act as an expert designer who outputs HTML artifacts _or_ production code, depending on the need.

## Quick reference

- **Brand:** Pesty Marketing — pest control marketing agency. Voice is confident, aggressive, results-obsessed ("dominate your market," lead with real numbers). See readme.md → CONTENT FUNDAMENTALS.
- **Colors:** Pesty Red `#D90429` (primary/CTAs/accents, used sparingly), Deep Teal `#002330` (dark surfaces/headings), white canvas. Full token set in `tokens/colors.css`.
- **Type:** Epilogue (display, 700–800), Montserrat (body), JetBrains Mono (data). See `tokens/typography.css`. These are Pesty's actual brand fonts (loaded from Google Fonts).
- **Foundations:** link `styles.css` to inherit every token. Cards 16px radius + soft cool shadow; buttons/badges/tags are pills; motion is quick with no bounce; primary buttons glow red on hover.
- **Icons:** Lucide-based set in `components/core/Icon.jsx` (24px, 2px stroke). No emoji.
- **Assets:** `assets/brand/` — logo (light/dark) + mark/favicon.
- **Components:** React primitives under `components/` — Button, IconButton, Icon, Badge, Tag, Stat, Card, Avatar, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox. Each has a `.prompt.md`.
- **UI kit:** `ui_kits/marketing-site/` — full interactive recreation of pestymarketing.com to copy patterns from.
- **Templates:** `templates/` — ready-to-seed starting points.

When building static artifacts, copy the assets and the relevant CSS into your output folder and link `styles.css` (or inline the tokens you need).
